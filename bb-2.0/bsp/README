Binary Space Partition (BSP) tree library
-----------------------------------------

This BSP code is from A. T. Campbell's C BSP library, v1.0.  It has been
modified slightly for increased speed.  If you plan to use this BSP library
in your own work, you should get an untainted, more recent copy from
A. T.'s web page at

  http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/~atc

...and you'll also get documentation which isn't here.
