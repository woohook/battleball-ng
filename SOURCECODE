Source code notes
-----------------

BattleBall is about 10,000 lines of C++ source code, not including
the Standard Template and BSP libraries that it uses.  The source code
compiles and runs on Unix / X11 Windows platforms.


Source directories
------------------

The BB source code distribution includes four directories:

stl/      HP's version of the C++ Standard Template Library
bsp/      A.T. Campbell's BSP C library, v1.0, modified
lib3d/    my 3-D modeling/rendering library (needs a real name :-)
bb/       BattleBall 2.0

The 3D modeling/rendering library in lib3d/ defines classes for
geometric primitives such as points, angles, polygons, and arbitrary
polygonal 3-D shapes.  The code in lib3d to rotate/transform and render
3-D shapes is optimized for speed.  Lib3d contains no code specific to
the game of BattleBall, and was written with the goal of being reusable
outside of BB.  Lib3d does not use OpenGL or Mesa.

The source code in bb/ implements all the gameplay of BattleBall.  It
has a fairly nice (IMO) object-oriented model for game objects and how
they behave/interact, which is new in version 2.0 of BB.  It also has
an algorithm for aiming projectiles at moving targets in the presence
of gravity.  If you want to modify BB or build your own game using BB's
infrastructure, the code in this directory is probably what you'll want
to modify.

You may see the mysterious comment "-PAH" sprinkled liberally thoughout
the source code.  For the most part, just ignore these.  They mark
places in the source code that have kludges or that could use further
work someday.
